### A BIG SOCIAL Problem
According to a recent national survey, 63.7% of men and 48.4% of women in our country are overweight, while obesity affects 19.3% of men and 18.0% Women's.
If current trends continue, it is expected that by 2035 the prevalence of severe obesity will affect 37% of the Spanish population. It is time to analyze this problem in depth.
